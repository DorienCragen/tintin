-fixed last line not being read if not ending with a new line in #readnew
-fixed actions not translating %0-%9
-fixed tintin freezing doing calculations with ( )

fixed for v1.90bb

-fixed buffer overflow in the scroll back buffer.
-fixed %d (date) not working right in #format
-fixed non trigger %1-%9 being translated in mud output
-fixed vars/functions/etc being translated in verbatim mode

Some feedback at last from a friend

-the command part of input has the variables and functions substituted right
 away, so variables containing #<command> will work.
-when passing a command to another session with the #sessionname feature the
 variables and functions are translated right away.

fixed for v1.90bc

-finished up the mathematical expression calculator some more. Added < > <= >=
 support for strings.
-patched readline bug, not updating the prompt correctly after cursormovements
-had changed readnew to read and read to readold, but changed my mind, and
 forgot to change it back or document it. In this version #read uses the
 standard read function again, and #readnew calls the special one
-fixed up the credits a bit, added Peter who was left out for some reason

changed for v1.90bd

-added some basic syntax highlighting for #act, #alias, etc. If this is
 considered gay (no offense meant) I'll change it back, but figured it could
 be easy for debugging.
-added #readold, which will attempt to make some small modifications for very
 minimal backward compatibility, see README for more information.
-added T and F back for mathematics, representing 1 and 0
-added the 'd' operator, which does a dice roll, for #math, 1d100 would give
 a random number between 1 and 100.

changed for v1.90b1

-fixed some minor issues with vt102 parsing and scrollback
-changed 'configure' command to 'config'
