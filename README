**** OLD TINTIN SCRIPTS ARE NOT 100% COMPATIBLE WITH THIS VERSION ****


It's hard to stay compatible with older versions and at the same time
improve the script parser. People who do not want to update their scripts
and figure out the differences will simply have to use the old version.


TINEXP 1.0 (tintin expressions) are as of now more clearly defined:

%0 - %9 are passed along with triggers. Actions, Aliasses, etc
$       are used for variables
@       are used for functions, the arguments are stored in %0 - %9
<000>   are used for colors
\       is used to escape a character, but doesn't always work.
{ }     are used for seperating multi word command arguments.
" "     are used for strings in #math
* ? \   are used as wildcards for string matching.



If you want to convert your scripts take notice of the following changes:

01) #LOOP and #FORALL now use &0 instead of %0.

02) #HIGHLIGHT had to be changed because this tintin version is less flexible
when it comes to the parsing of commands as the old tintin versions. Basicly
the old #high {color} {string} is now parsed as: #high {string} {color} 
You can load your old highlights, but they will not be added to the highlight
list, because they'll generate a 'color code not found' error message. So
you'll have to redo your highlights, or perhaps look into the #substite
command combined with the new color codes, see #help colors

Also the way highlight deals with colors has been changed. {b light green} is
no longer valid, instead you would want to use {bold b green}, the highlights
also only use the valid VT100 codes, italic has been replaced with underscore,
since italic was never part of the protocol of VT100 terminals.

03) #FORMAT replaces many commands, I'd suggest checking it out.

04) #MESSAGE, #CONFIG, #IGNORE, #DEBUG are all you need to configure
   tintin, changes to #config are written to file with #write.

05) The old walk code has been removed, instead you can use the #path command.

06) #TICK has been changed quite a bit, new commands: #TICK #UNTICK, you can
have as many tickers as you want. The old #tick commands are gone.
Syntax: #tick {name} {commands} {seconds to tick}
The name is added so you can delete it. You will no longer receive spam, but
with a little bit of creativity you can rebuild the old tintin ticker spam.

Can use #read to load this simulator, for the few muds that still have a
non random tick:

#tick {oldtick}
{
	#delay 50 #showme #10 SECONDS TO TICK!!;
	#showme #TICK!!!
}
{60}


07) #read now supports multiline triggers, it also checks the nesting level
before doing anything so you don't end up with bogus, and trims leading 
spaces/tabs. Make sure to remove non matching { }'s from #nop comments. Cause
it'll error msg with the line number to look at otherwise.


08) Can place ^ at the end of an action if you want a perfect match.
#act {^The trail leads north^} {n} {5} will not trigger on:
The trail leads northwest

   In order to make a color trigger start a trigger with ~ In order to see
   color codes the way tintin wants you to enter them type: #config CONVERT on
   when done use: #config CONVERT off.

09) Added macros, see help file on macro and unmacro

10) Finished function code, $result is now a default variable that can be used

#function dosomething {#math result 1 + 1}

say @dosomething{} will print 2, the #RESULT command has been removed.

You can still use the result variable as a normal variable, but it might get
messy if you use it in combination with #echo or functions, or both.

11) #forall and loop now use space seperation instead of comma seperation.

13) Rewrote the mathematical expression interpreter used by #if and #math,
it can now deal with both strings and numbers, strings must be enclosed in " ",
and has more options, see help on math. T and F are not supported, use 0 and
1 since I'm trying to comply to C standards.

14) #pathdir is now specificly designed to hold a direction, and the opposite
direction, there was some confusion by a help file writer about this who
thought it was meant to hold a direction and the specific command to use with
that direction. Pathdir now also needs a 3rd argument for the #map command,
these values are set automatically.

15) Defaults are no longer in a .rc file, if someone wants different defaults
they can write a command file for it.

16) Can now set the top and bottom row of the scrolling region with #split.

17) Can now have multiple prompt triggers, the 2nd argument is the substitution
string that works the same as #substitute. the 3rd argument is the row the
line should be printed on, if left blank it picks the normal split line.

18) Fixed suspend for tintin sessions started using a linux script

19) #sleep has been removed, use #delay.

20) Tintin is now capable of wordwrapping, can be disabled with #config.

21) Fixed color loss bug in split mode for muds that send wrapped lines.

22) #system can no longer be renamed, I fixed the %0-9 issue passing along ';'
removing the $0-9 'bug fix' variable - which nobody seemed to use anyway.

23) Settings are now inherited from the startup session when creating a new
session.

25) Added internal color codes, see help color

26) MCCP and NAWS support added

28) Scroll back buffer, with scrolling macros, home, pgup, pgdown, end, and
    a #grep command to search through the buffer added

29) cursor positioning for split mode has been fixed once and for all hopefully

34 !<argument> will repeat the last command starting with that argument.
   score
   who all
   area
   !          --> repeats area
   !w         --> repeats who all
   !s         --> repeats score
   !ll        --> sends !ll as a command

35 You can turn on repeat on enter with the #config command
