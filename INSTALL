Installation is easy; cd to the src/ directory, then type this:

./configure
make

If this went without errors or serious warnings type this to start tintin:

./tt++


If you put the readline library in a non standard location, you can
do a ./configure --includedir=<location> --libdir=<location>/readline to 
specify it. For example, if you put the readline library in /tmp/readline, 
you can do

./configure --includedir=/tmp --libdir=/tmp/readline


Options configure current supports:
--includedir    Additional include directory
--bindir        Location you want tt++ to be installed (default is the src dir)
--libdir        Addition library directory
--enable-big5   To use the big5 encoding

If you wish, you can edit src/Makefile.in before running ./configure.
It shouldn't be necessary unless you have some unorthodox request
(such as wanting to install tintin++ /usr/local).

If you have any trouble with installing/compiling tintin, you can use
the gripe command in src/ directory to send email.  Please include
the OS, compiler and the error message that you have.  Or you can email
us at tintin@newclear.net.


TERMINAL EMULATION:

In order to run tintin full featured you will need a vt102 emulator. If your
OS doesn't use one per default it's suggested to install rxvt (also known as
wterm). If you are using cygwin for example you might want to do the following:

cat x < rxvt -bg 0 -fg 15 -cr 2 -fn "courier-15" -fb "courier-15" +sb -tn xterm -e /usr/bin/bash --login -i&
chmod 777 x
./x

This will start up rxvt configured as an old school putty terminal everytime
you type ./x  next you can run tintin in split mode.
