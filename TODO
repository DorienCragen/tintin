* Stuff that needs to be done

- Look into [A|An] parsing bug.

- fix stunnel #run

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL STUFF:

- Treat variables passed along to functions by value.

- See if it's possible to add better #path run support.

- Events for prompt lines.

- Add a #line skip option.

- Tab completion based on scroll back history.

- Add a pre-parser to determine whether a trigger is a regex or color
  trigger.

- Leave unmatched backslashes untouched? - double escapes required in regex.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

READLINE:

Use \e[ X to erase an amount of characters to deal with ctrl-r and redraw line functionality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAPPING STUFF:

- Display hidden exits differently.

- Synchronise drawn map with the link map.

- Add support to set exit and hiddenexit colors.

- A method to double check correct movement.

- A method to highlight a route on the map

- A method to add a note for a room.

- A method to find a generic room more precisely by giving exits and other identifying information.,

- Better #map undo support.

- Add conditional if checks for room traversal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* This is a list of improvements that are planned for a rainy day.

- auto create coord flag for pathdirs.

- Perl compatible regular expressions.

- Shift-tab complete on keywords from the scrollback buffer.

- Buffer safe strings.

- Fix up ipv6 support in chat.

- Look into packet defragmentation for chat.

- Color code compression, particularly useful with vt map drawing.

- link http://www.lauzet.com/argon on webpage

- look into %0^ not working.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Stuff that has been request but that I'm not entirely sure about

- Allow actions to use ! to repeat commands, possibly use #history 1. Not as
  easy at it seems.

- Place #grep output in the buffer. This may not be desirable however.

- Add a command to manipulate the input buffer.

- Add color compression to the strip_non_vt function.

- Keep last input visible with repeat enter enabled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* This is a list of new features/improvements I'm not interest in.

- X window support: console is just fine.

- MXP support, will be tricky with tintin++ being a console client, a good
  starting point might be libmxp provided by the creator of kmuddy.

  http://www.kmuddy.org/libmxp/

  Tintin will also need a html terminal, which isn't available yet.

- MSP support: I'm not aware of a good easy cross platform sound library. You
  can use a command line sound mixer with the #system command.

- Plugins: Maybe sometime far in the future I'll add a plugin to add plugins.
