* Stuff that needs to be done

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL STUFF:

- events for prompt lines

- add line substitute option, to substitute variables and functions.

- add a #line skip command.

- tab completion based on scroll back history

- look into mccp routine which sometimes doesn't work properly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

READLINE:

Use \e[ X to erase an amount of characters to deal with ctrl-r and redraw line functionality.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPING STUFF:

- look into #map walk working correctly.

- look into adding a crawler to find rooms, so the avoid flag can be used to only search rooms within an area.

- a method to double check correct movement.

- a method to highlight a route on the map

- a method to mark a room on the map for corpse retreival etc.

- a method to add a note for a room (probably scripted support with events)

- a method to find the most nearby generic room.

- a method to find a generic room more precisely by giving exits and other identifying information.

- check #map undo integrity.

- Add info about which room you're in when leaving the map.

- add conditional if checks for room traversal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* This is a list of improvements that are planned for a rainy day.

- Buffer safe strings (partial implementation finished)

- fix up ipv6 support in chat.c

- look into packet defragmentation for chat

- shift-tab complete on the scrollback buffer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Stuff that has been request but that I'm not entirely sure about

- allow actions to use ! to repeat commands, possibly use #history 1, not as
  easy at it seems.

- upgrade the #write command to format. Format should be up to the user though.

- place #grep output in the buffer. This is not desirable however.

- add a command to manipulate the input buffer.

- add color compression to the strip_non_vt function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* This is a list of new features/improvements the author of this version has no
  interest in.

- X window support: console is just fine.

- mxp support, will be tricky with tintin++ being a console client, a good
  starting point might be libmxp provided by the creator of kmuddy.

  http://www.kmuddy.org/libmxp/

  Tintin will also need a html terminal, which isn't available yet.

- msp support: I'm not aware of a good easy cross platform sound library. You
  can use a command line sound mixer with the #system command.

- plugins: Maybe sometime far in the future I'll add a plugin to add plugins.
