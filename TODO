* Stuff that needs to be done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAPPING STUFF:

- a method to double check correct movement.

- a method to highlight a route on the map

- a travel/explore option.

- a method to mark a room on the map for corpse retreival etc.

- a method to add filler rooms for mazy muds

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL STUFF:

Add insert toggle

Look into prompt handling in #split with #showme and macros.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* This is a list of new features/improvements that are planned.

- event system to deal with various situations

- Buffer safe strings

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Stuff that has been request but that I'm not entirely sure about

- allow actions to use ! to repeat commands, possibly use #history 1, not as
  easy at it seems.

- fix up macro usage in character mode.

- Add color bleeding for #split. Bloats the code though.

- upgrade the #write command to format. Format should be up to the user.

- place #grep output in the buffer. This is not desirable however.

- add a command to manipulate the input buffer.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* This is a list of new features/improvements the author of this version has no
  interest in.

- X window support: console is just fine.

- mxp support, will be tricky with tintin++ being a console client, a good
  starting point might be libmxp provided by the creator of kmuddy.

  http://www.kmuddy.org/libmxp/

  Tintin will also need a html terminal, which isn't available yet.

- msp support: I'm not aware of a good easy cross platform sound library. You
  can use a command line sound mixer with the #system command.

- plugins: Maybe sometime far in the future I'll add a plugin to add plugins.

- external script support: Python, Ruby, etc is fun, but I'd rather develop
  tintin's scripting language instead. You can use external scripts with
  the #system command, write the scripts output to a file, and use #read to
  execute it.
