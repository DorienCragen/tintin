* Stuff that isn't that hard to do, but somehow never ends up being fixed.

- allow actions to use ! to repeat commands, possibly use #history 1

- fix up macro usage in character mode.

- Add a FAQ to the website.

- Add color bleeding for #split


* This is a list of new features/improvements that are planned.

- auto mapper (half finished)

- custom readline support (some progress has been made)

- floating point calculations (tricky)

- code that deals with broken lines (beta, seems to work)

- event system to deal with various situations

- Add (his|her|it) for triggers.



* This is a list of new features/improvements the author of this version has
  no interest in.

- X window support: console is just fine.

- mxp support, will be tricky with tintin++ being a console client, a good
  starting point might be libmxp provided by the creator of kmuddy.

  http://www.kmuddy.org/libmxp/

  Tintin will also need a html terminal, which isn't available yet.

- msp support: I'm not aware of a good easy cross platform sound library.

- plugins: Maybe sometime far in the future I'll add a plugin to add plugins.

- external script support: Python, Ruby, etc is fun, but I'd rather develop
  tintin's scripting language instead.
