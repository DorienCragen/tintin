* This is a list of new features/improvements that are planned.

* This is a list of new features/improvements the author of this version has
  no interest in.

- full telnet support: the default telnet program should be sufficient.

- X window support: console is just fine.

- mxp support, will be tricky with tintin++ being a console client, a good
  starting point might be libmxp provided by the creator of kmuddy.

  Tintin will also need a hypertext terminal, which is being developed here:

- msp support: my sound card does not work, and nobody asked yet.
